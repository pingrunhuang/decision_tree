# Dataset description
this project's dataset is from this [kaggle competetion](www.kaggle.com/zaurbegiev/my-dataset/data/). You can find some description there. But basically the column is self-explained.

# Project description
This is my self implementation of the decision tree.

To run the unittest:
```
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`
$ cd test
$ python -m unittest common_func_testing.py
```

# Problems 1

1. the larger the entropy is, the more uncertain a variable is.


# The purpose of the info gain is by knowing the info of a certain feature X, how much uncertainty we can reduce to determine which class Y belongs to.
